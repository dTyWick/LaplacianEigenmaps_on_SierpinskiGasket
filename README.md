# LaplacianEigenmaps_on_SierpinskiGasket
Through numerical investigations of the resistance metric on Poisson-weighted graph approximations of the Sierpinski Gasket (SG), we provide evidence of the extension of the Laplacian Eigenmaps technique to non-smooth spaces, using SG as a foundational example.
